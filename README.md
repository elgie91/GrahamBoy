# GrahamBoy
A GameBoy (not Color) Emulator written in C++

### Features
* Accurate CPU and Memory emulation
* 4-bit Grayscale Palette
* Plays most .gb games
* Ability to overclock CPU x100
* 60fps Display

### Motivation
Motivation for undergoing this project was to improve my C++ skills, learn more about emulators, and build one of my favorite systems.

### Built with
* [SDL] (https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) - Graphics Framework
* [Visual Studio] (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - IDE

### TODO
* Include Save states
* Include Audio
* Allow for changing games without re-compiling (As of now, games are hard coded in the source)
